# Challenges:

Checking for errors and warnings using NU validator is a must and a habit that I want to build early on. Doing so will help me tuned to the ideals of CI/CD of DevOps and I also find the links accompanying the warnings and errors very helpful. An example is learning from this page: [](https://html5accessibility.com/stuff/2021/07/08/preserved-in-html/) after getting this:

![html checker remarks 1](./images/html-checker-remarks2.png)

I also learned how to use ascii codes of certain emoticons that uses the "less than or greater than signal" that can affect the parsing of my code:

![html checker remarks 2](./images/html-checker-remarks1.png)

Which I replaced with:

![fix for html checker remarks 2](./images/updated_hearts.jpg)

# Resolved:

Finally got them validated: <3 ... ooops &hearts;Â  rather.. :)  oh no.. I don't know  what the ascii for this ":)" smiley face. Oh, well!
